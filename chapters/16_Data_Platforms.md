# Chapter 16 — Data Platforms

## Why Intelligence Systems Require Scalable Data Infrastructure

* Decision intelligence systems depend on continuous access to large volumes of data.
* As organizations collect information from transactions, user interactions, sensors, and operational systems, data volume and complexity increase rapidly.
* Simple databases designed for transactional processing are not sufficient for advanced analytics and machine learning workflows.
* Intelligence systems require infrastructure capable of:

  * storing large datasets reliably
  * supporting analytical queries across many variables
  * enabling model training on historical data
  * delivering data quickly to operational decision systems
* Without scalable infrastructure, data pipelines become fragmented, inconsistent, and difficult to manage.
* Data platforms solve this challenge by providing **a unified foundation for storing, processing, and serving organizational data**.

## Integrating Multiple Data Storage Paradigms

* Modern data platforms combine several types of storage systems designed for different analytical needs.

* These systems organize data in ways that support both exploration and large-scale processing.

* Common storage components include:

  * **Data warehouses**

    * structured repositories optimized for analytical queries
    * designed for structured datasets and business intelligence reporting

  * **Data lakes**

    * flexible storage environments that hold large volumes of raw data
    * capable of storing structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data

* Data warehouses provide performance and governance, while data lakes provide flexibility and scalability.

* Organizations often use both approaches to support different types of analytical workloads.

## The Emergence of Lakehouse Architectures

* Managing separate lakes and warehouses can introduce complexity and data duplication.
* To address this challenge, modern architectures combine these capabilities into a **lakehouse model**.
* Lakehouse architectures integrate the flexibility of data lakes with the performance and reliability of data warehouses.
* Key characteristics of lakehouse systems include:

  * unified storage layer for raw and structured data
  * support for SQL-based analytics and machine learning workloads
  * improved data governance and transaction management
* This architecture allows organizations to support analytics, machine learning, and reporting within a **single integrated data platform**.

## Managing Model Inputs Through Feature Stores

* Machine learning systems rely on carefully engineered inputs known as **features**.

* Feature engineering often occurs repeatedly across multiple models and teams.

* Feature stores provide a centralized system for managing and reusing these inputs.

* Key roles of feature stores include:

  * storing validated feature definitions
  * ensuring consistency between training datasets and production inference
  * enabling reuse of commonly engineered features across models
  * supporting real-time or batch feature retrieval for operational systems

* By managing model inputs systematically, feature stores reduce duplication and improve the reliability of predictive systems.

### Explanation

The diagram illustrates how data platforms organize and prepare data for decision intelligence systems.

* **Raw data sources** generate operational data across the organization.
* A **data lake** stores this data in its original form for flexible processing.
* A **data warehouse** organizes structured data optimized for analytical queries.
* A **feature store** manages engineered inputs used by machine learning models.
* These components collectively supply data to **decision intelligence systems** that generate insights and decisions.

This layered architecture enables organizations to transform raw operational data into structured intelligence-ready inputs.

### Guidance for Drawing in PowerPoint

Layout:

* Use a **vertical layered architecture diagram**.

Shapes:

* Rectangles representing each layer:

  * Raw Data Sources
  * Data Lake
  * Data Warehouse
  * Feature Store
  * Decision Intelligence Systems

Arrows:

* Use downward arrows showing the flow of data through the layers.

Design suggestions:

* Place the storage layers in the middle of the diagram to emphasize the platform foundation.
* Keep labels short and consistent.
* Optionally highlight **Feature Store** as the bridge between data infrastructure and machine learning systems.

## Example Section — Data Platform Architecture in an Online Retail Company

Consider how an online retail platform organizes its data infrastructure.

Mapping this scenario to the diagram:

1. **Raw Data Sources**

   * Customer transactions, browsing logs, product catalog updates, and inventory data are generated continuously.

2. **Data Lake**

   * All raw events are stored in a scalable storage system that preserves the original data for future analysis.

3. **Data Warehouse**

   * Structured tables summarize transactional data, enabling analysts to run queries on sales trends, customer segments, and product performance.

4. **Feature Store**

   * Machine learning features such as:

     * customer purchase frequency
     * average spending patterns
     * product popularity metrics
       are stored and reused by predictive models.

5. **Decision Intelligence Systems**

   * Recommendation models, demand forecasting systems, and pricing algorithms use these features to guide operational decisions.

Through this architecture, the company ensures that data flows efficiently from operational systems to analytics and intelligence systems.

## Final Section — Building the Foundation for Intelligence Systems

* Data platforms provide the infrastructure that supports modern decision intelligence ecosystems.
* By integrating storage systems, analytical processing, and machine learning inputs, these platforms transform raw data into usable intelligence.
* Scalable and well-designed platforms ensure that data pipelines remain reliable as organizations grow and decision systems become more sophisticated.
* Without this infrastructure, advanced analytics and machine learning systems would struggle to operate effectively.

**Transition to the Next Chapter**

Data platforms provide the infrastructure for storing, processing, and serving information at scale. However, infrastructure alone is not enough—decision systems depend on data that is reliable and trustworthy. The next chapter examines how organizations establish data trust through quality monitoring, governance, and transparency.
